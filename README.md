# cs210 Final Project

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project takes a list of items sold, totals the amount of specific items, and creates a new file, or receipt, of items sold and the quantity. It also prints a histogram as another way to show items sold.

# What did you do particularly well?
I thought it went well overall. Everything worked as expected.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think this program could be expanded on to include a database, organized by date, and searchable by items, days, hours, profit, and sales. I imagine any store would have a program like this handy to track sales. The histogram is a bonus addition. I think to enhance this code for practicality, it should be removed. Also, the requirements specified reading the created file frequency.dat, which is unessessary in the real world to manipulate data, print, and then read and print again. To make the code more efficient I would have made the histogram from the orgininal file along with the sales results.


# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The Python code was challenging because it has been over 2 years since I coded in Python. I overcame it by doing research. Basic "how to" inquiries into a search engine, and then adapted what I found to the programs needs. Also a lot of trial and error was involved. As far as resources, I've heard good things about github, but never looked into it until now. I also have support books available in Python, Java, and C++ that I purchased to aid me.


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Combining two languages. This I'm sure I'll see more of and I'm glad I was able to utilize them effectively. 


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The in-line commenting made this program maintainable and readable to other developers. They know exactly what each section or function is supposed to be doing. I also used proper naming conventions and spacing to enhance readability. It is adaptable because it is simple. That way the code could be reused for other purposes, like I described above about making it more practical, or adding a database to it.
